Introduction
============

The ARCH toolbox contains routines for:

- Univariate volatility models;
- Bootstrapping;
- Multiple comparison procedures;
- Unit root tests;
- Cointegration Testing and Estimation; and
- Long-run covariance estimation.

Future plans are to continue to expand this toolbox to include additional
routines relevant for the analysis of financial data.
