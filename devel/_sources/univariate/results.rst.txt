Model Results
=============
All model return the same object, a results class (:class:`~arch.univariate.base.ARCHModelResult`).
When using the ``fix`` method, a (:class:`~arch.univariate.base.ARCHModelFixedResult`) is produced
that lacks some properties of a (:class:`~arch.univariate.base.ARCHModelResult`) that are not
relevant when parameters are not estimated.
