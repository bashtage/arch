Changes since 4.0
=================
- Fixed a bug in MCS when using the max method that prevented all included models from being
  listed
- Added ``FixedVariance`` volatility process which allows pre-specified variances to be used with
  a mean model.  This has been added to allow so-called zig-zag estimation where a mean model is
  estimated with a fixed variance, and then a variance model is estimated on the residuals using
  a ``ZeroMean`` variance process.
- Fixed a bug that prevented ``fix`` from being used with a new model (:issue:`156`)
- Added ``first_obs`` and ``last_obs`` parameters to ``fix`` to mimic ``fit``
- Added ability to jointly estimate smoothing parameter in EWMA variance when fitting the model
- Added Component GARCH process which decomposes volatility into long run and short run components.
  The model comes with an extra ``longterm_var`` attribute when fit.
