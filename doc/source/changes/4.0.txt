Version 4
=========

Since 4.12
==========
- Improved exceptions in :class:`~arch.unitroot.ADF`,  :class:`~arch.unitroot.KPSS`,
  :class:`~arch.unitroot.PhillipsPerron`, and :class:`~arch.unitroot.ZivotAndrews` when
  test specification is infeasible to the time series being too short or the
  required regression model having reduced rank (:issue:`364`).
- Fixed a bug when using "bca" confidence intervals with ``extra_kwargs`` (:issue:`366`).
- Added Phillips-Ouliaris (:func:`~arch.unitroot.cointegration.phillips_ouliaris`)
  cointegration tests (:issue:`360`).
- Added three methods to estimate cointegrating vectors:
  :class:`~arch.unitroot.cointegration.CanonicalCointegratingReg`,
  :class:`~arch.unitroot.cointegration.DynamicOLS`, and
  :class:`~arch.unitroot.cointegration.FullyModifiedOLS`
  (:issue:`356`, :issue:`359`).
- Added the Engle-Granger (:func:`~arch.unitroot.cointegration.engle_granger`)
  cointegration test (:issue:`354`).
- Issue warnings when unit root tests are mutated. Will raise after 5.0
  is released.
- Fixed a bug in :class:`arch.univariate.SkewStudent` which did not use the
  user-provided `RandomState` when one was provided. This prevented
  reproducing simulated values (:issue:`353`).

Release 4.12
============
- Added typing support to all classes, functions and methods (:issue:`338`,
  :issue:`341`, :issue:`342`, :issue:`343`, :issue:`345`, :issue:`346`).
- Fixed an issue that caused tests to fail on SciPy 1.4+ (:issue:`339`).
- Dropped support for Python 3.5 inline with NEP 29 (:issue:`334`).
- Added methods to compute moment and lower partial moments for standardized
  residuals. See, for example, :func:`~arch.univariate.SkewStudent.moment` and
  :func:`~arch.univariate.SkewStudent.partial_moment` (:issue:`329`).
- Fixed a bug that produced an OverflowError when a time series has no
  variance (:issue:`331`).

Release 4.11
============
- Added :func:`~arch.univariate.base.ARCHModelResult.std_resid` (:issue:`326`).
- Error if inputs are not ndarrays, DataFrames or Series (:issue:`315`).
- Added a check that the covariance is non-zero when using "studentized" confidence intervals.
  If the function bootstrapped produces statistics with 0 variance, it is not possible to
  studentized (:issue:`322`).

Release 4.10
============
- Fixed a bug in arch_lm_test that assumed that the model data is contained in
  a pandas Series. (:issue:`313`).
- Fixed a bug that can affect use in certain environments that reload modules
  (:issue:`317`).

Release 4.9
===========
- Removed support for Python 2.7.
- Added :func:`~arch.unitroot.auto_bandwidth` to compute optimized bandwidth
  for a number of common kernel covariance estimators (:issue:`303`). This code
  was written by Michael Rabba.
- Added a parameter `rescale` to :func:`~arch.univariate.mean.arch_model`
  that allows the estimator to rescale data if it may help parameter
  estimation. If `rescale=True`, then the data will be rescaled by a power
  of 10 (e.g., 10, 100, or 1000) to produce a series with a residual
  variance between 1 and 1000. The model is then estimated on the rescaled
  data. The scale is reported :func:`~arch.univariate.base.ARCHModelResult.scale`.
  If `rescale=None`, a warning is produced if the data appear to be poorly
  scaled, but no change of scale is applied. If `rescale=False`, no scale
  change is applied and no warning is issued.
- Fixed a bug when using the BCA bootstrap method where the leave-one-out
  jackknife used the wrong centering variable (:issue:`288`).
- Added :func:`~arch.univariate.base.ARCHModelResult.optimization_result` to
  simplify checking for convergence of the numerical optimizer (:issue:`292`).
- Added `random_state` argument to :func:`~arch.univariate.HARX.forecast`
  to allow a :class:`~numpy.random.RandomState` object to be passed in when
  forecasting when `method='bootstrap'`. This allows the repeatable forecast to
  be produced (:issue:`290`).
- Fixed a bug in :class:`~arch.unitroot.VarianceRatio` that used the wrong
  variance in nonrobust inference with overlapping samples (:issue:`286`).

Release 4.8.1
=============
- Fixed a bug which prevented extension modules from being correctly imported.

Release 4.8
===========
- Added Zivot-Andrews unit root test :class:`~arch.unitroot.ZivotAndrews`.
  This code was originally written by Jim Varanelli.
- Added data dependent lag length selection to the KPSS test,
  :class:`~arch.unitroot.KPSS`. This code was originally written by
  Jim Varanelli.
- Added :class:`~arch.bootstrap.IndependentSamplesBootstrap` to
  perform bootstrap inference on statistics from independent samples that may
  have uneven length (:issue:`260`).
- Added :func:`~arch.univariate.base.ARCHModelResult.arch_lm_test` to
  perform ARCH-LM tests on model residuals or standardized residuals
  (:issue:`261`).
- Fixed a bug in :class:`~arch.unitroot.ADF` when applying to very short time series
  (:issue:`262`).
- Added ability to set the ``random_state`` when initializing a bootstrap
  (:issue:`259`).

Release 4.7
===========
- Added support for Fractionally Integrated GARCH (FIGARCH) in
  :class:`~arch.univariate.FIGARCH`.
- Enable user to specify a specific value of the `backcast` in place of
  the automatically generated value.
- Fixed a big where parameter-less models where incorrectly reported as
  having constant variance (:issue:`248`).


Release 4.6
===========
- Added support for MIDAS volatility processes using Hyperbolic
  weighting in :class:`~arch.univariate.MidasHyperbolic`
  (:issue:`233`).

Release 4.5
===========
- Added a parameter to forecast that allows a user-provided callable random
  generator to be used in place of the model random generator (:issue:`225`).
- Added a low memory automatic lag selection method that can be used with very
  large time-series.
- Improved performance of automatic lag selection in ADF and related tests.

Release 4.4
===========
- Added named parameters to Dickey-Fuller regressions.
- Removed use of the module-level NumPy RandomState. All random number
  generators use separate RandomState instances.
- Fixed a bug that prevented 1-step forecasts with exogenous regressors.
- Added the Generalized Error Distribution for univariate ARCH models.
- Fixed a bug in MCS when using the max method that prevented all included
  models from being listed.

Release 4.3
===========
- Added :class:`~arch.univariate.FixedVariance` volatility process which
  allows pre-specified variances to be used with a mean model.  This has been
  added to allow so-called zig-zag estimation where a mean model is estimated
  with a fixed variance, and then a variance model is estimated on the residuals
  using a ``ZeroMean`` variance process.

Release 4.2
===========
- Fixed a bug that prevented ``fix`` from being used with a new model
  (:issue:`156`).
- Added ``first_obs`` and ``last_obs`` parameters to ``fix`` to mimic ``fit``.
- Added ability to jointly estimate smoothing parameter in EWMA variance when
  fitting the model.
- Added ability to pass optimization options to ARCH model estimation
  (:issue:`195`).
